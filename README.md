# Mandelbulb_Minecraft
Mandelbulb 3D fractal in minecraft using python. 

## The inspiration was a new minecraft project for my survival world. 
I watched a [Mandelbulb video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCiUVGiNyA&t=959s) by [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)
which gave me idea if I can make one in minecraft.

I used nbtschematics to make a schematics for minecraft that can be loaded in the game using litematica, world edit or 
any other schematics tools.

This project took a lot of time as I needed to understand the maths behind fractals and also 
how can I write faster code as the previous iterations were extremely slow.

It was a fun project as I love wasting time...
